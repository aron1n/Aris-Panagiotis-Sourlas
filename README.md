👋 Hello, I’m Aris

Welcome to my repository! The purpose of this space is to share a bit about my background and why I am here on GitHub.

🎓 I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Biomedical Engineering from the University of West Attica (Athens, Greece). Along the way, I developed a strong specialization in IT, databases, and cloud technologies.

🌍 I am originally from Volos, Greece, and have worked across different industries—from healthcare and technical support to retail and logistics—always looking for opportunities to apply technology to solve real-world problems.

🚀 My goal is to learn new things, expand my technical expertise, and contribute to scientific and IT-driven projects within international teams.

🔧 Areas of Interest & Skills

Application & Database Support (SQL, CRM, incident handling)

Cloud & Systems (Azure fundamentals, Docker/Kubernetes basics)

Technical Troubleshooting (hardware/software, networks, medical devices)

Compliance (GDPR, ITIL familiarity, documentation)

📚 Always eager to improve through certifications, hands-on projects, and collaboration.

✨ Thanks for visiting my repo — feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn!
